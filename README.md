adboost-demo
============

Build instructions:

1. Copy the following into the 'libs' folder:
  libs/
    armeabi-v7a/
      libocs.so
    adboost.jar
    adience.jar
2. Copy into the libs folder the jar(s) of the ad network(s) that you want to integrate with. Note that some of them will require you to reference an entire project, such as 'google-play-services_lib' or 'mopub-sdk'.
3. Edit AndroidManifest.xml: Remove the stuff that's irrelevant to the ad network(s) you're integarting with, and fill in the stuff which is relevant, if there is any (appId, devId, package name etc.)
4. Comment out the code in the activities of the irrelevant ad networks (it won't compile because the jar is not in the libs folder).
5. Edit MainActivity.java and assign your AdBoost API key to the constant MY_ADBOOST_ID.
6. Go over the activities of the ad networks you want to integrate with, and assign your appId / adId to the relevant constants.

Optional (if using only one ad network):

5. Edit AndroidManifest.xml and move the <intent-filter> from MainActivity to the activity of that ad network.
6. Edit the java file of that activity and uncomment the code in the onCreate and onDestroy methods.
